# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how David Takaƒç ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, retains, and discloses information from users of the FERIT Schedule app ("the App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before using the App.

## 1. App Overview

The App contains a WebView that displays a modified webpage of the online class schedule of The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek. Users can enter their study programme and year, and the app will automatically place them on the schedule of the current day for their study programme. The App allows users to remove unneeded HTML elements and scripts for performance improvement. The App collects no information about the user, and all entered options remain in local storage.

## 2. Data Collection

The App does not collect any user data. It contains no telemetry, and crash reports displayed in the Play Console are anonymous and limited to app version and device information.

## 3. Data Usage

The App collects no data and is not shared with any third parties. The "Bug Report" button allows users to send bug reports to the developer's email address. Bug reports are used solely for the purpose of fixing the app, and no information is sent or used for any other purpose.

## 4. User Consent

Since the App collects no data, there is no need for user consent.

## 5. Security Measures

No user data is collected; hence, no specific security measures are implemented.

## 6. Data Retention

Email data received through bug reports is retained only until the bug is fixed. Once fixed, the email data is deleted immediately.

## 7. User Rights

The App does not store personal information; therefore, users have no personal data to access, update, or delete.

## 8. Policy Changes

Users can periodically check the privacy policy for updates. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.

## 9. Contact Information

For privacy concerns or questions, users can contact us at developer.takac@mailbox.org.
